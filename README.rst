2) Eg: Probability of any transaction to be successfull is set in the code, so according to that probability the transaction succeeds or fails
3) Similar kind of probability is set for Availability of Expensive Payment Gateway
4) Data Type of Incoming Data, it is assumed that the Credit Card Number cannot be alphanumeric, etc
